### 🥤Custom Smoothie Ordering Application

#### 🌟 Project Overview
The project involves the development of a web-page designed using StreamLit for ordering customized smoothies. Users can customize their smoothies by selecting from a variety of fruits, with real-time nutritional insights powered by the FruityVice API.

#### 🔹 How It Works?
1️⃣ Pick Your Fruits – Choose your favorite fruits from a variety of options.

2️⃣ View Nutrition Info – Get real-time nutritional details for each selected fruit.

3️⃣ Place Your Order – Your smoothie preferences are saved in a Snowflake database for tracking.

4️⃣ Order Processing – The order enters the Pending Smoothie Orders queue for preparation.

5️⃣ Order Completion – Once prepared, the order status is updated in the database, and it's removed from the pending queue.
